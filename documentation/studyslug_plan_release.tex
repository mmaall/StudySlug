        \item A user may initiate a new study group for a course they are enrolled in, and the app will provide suggestions for study partners who are enrolled in the same course.
        \item A user may request to be notified when new study groups are formed for the courses they are enrolled in.
        \item A group leader can configure a recurring study group, including features such as scheduling, links to shared documentation, and locations.
        \item Prototype testing?
        \item Continuous integration?
        \item Website?
